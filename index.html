 <h1> About ServiceSPOTTER </h1> 
 <br>ServiceSPOTTER is a app created by Arushi Sharma, a High School student volunteer. </br>

<br> This app helps Homeless and Low-Income communities connect to services using a mobile app where they can connect with various service providers e.g., Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Health care. The app currently has resources for Austin, Texas. Plans are in place to expand the services to Texas State and nation-wide. </br> 

The App Users can access the app to get the following services:
 <ul>
<li> Explore details of any service provider to get details like contact info, transit directions and schedule for that service.  </li> 
<li> Obtain directions of the service provider from your location. </li> 
<li> Like any service or give comments on any service </li> 
<li> Ability to request for any missing service providers </li> 
<li> Ask the forum about any questions regarding any service </li> 
<li> Interactive Chat Box Spotty to assist the users </li> 
<li> Volunteer opportunities </li> 
<li> Donation to Local Austin Organization </li> 
 </ul>
 
<br> You can access all the services listed above through the Menu located in the top left hand corner of the app. </br>
